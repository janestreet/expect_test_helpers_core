`Expect_test_helpers_core` is a library intended for use with expect
tests, i.e. the `let%expect_test` syntax. It is an extension of the
`Expect_test_helpers_base` library with functionality dependent on
`Core_kernel`, in particular stable types and allocation tests that
use the `Core_kernel.Gc` module.

`Expect_test_helpers_core` does not use `Unix` or `Async`. It is
suitable for use in JavaScript. Also see the
`Expect_test_helpers_async` library, which provides test helpers that
work in Async and with additional helper functions that make use of
Unix processes.
