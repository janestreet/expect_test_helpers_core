`Expect_test_helpers_base` is a library intended for use with expect
tests, i.e. the `let%expect_test` syntax. It has functions that are
generally useful in writing expect tests, and are aimed at printing
output to appear in `[%expect]` expressions. Widely used functions
include: `print_s`, `require`, and `show_raise`.

`Expect_test_helpers_base` depends on `Base` and does not use Unix or
Async. It is suitable for use in JavaScript. Also see the
`Expect_test_helpers_kernel` library, which extends
`Expect_test_helpers_base` with functionality relevant to
`Core_kernel`.
